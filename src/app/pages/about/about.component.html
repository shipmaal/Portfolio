                My name is Alan Shipman. I am a Junior Computer Science
                major at Boston College. I am interested in the CS field and
                am looking for a job in the industry. I hope that this website
                can be used to showcase my skills and experience beyond
                what my resume can do.

                Throughout this site I hope to tell you more about myself,
                share some of my projects, display my musical works, and in
                general give you a better idea of who I am.
