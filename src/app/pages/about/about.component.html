                My name is Alan Shipman. I am a Junior Computer Science
                major at Boston College. I am interested in the CS field and
                am looking for a job in the industry. I hope that this website
                can be used to showcase my skills and experience beyond
                what my resume can do.

                share some of my projects, display my musical works, and in
                general give you a better idea of who I am.

                Throughout this page you will get a detailed view of my
                education, my coding progress and experience, and my musical experience.
                The coding page will be akin to a dev log. It will explain the thought
                process for each of my projects as well as the challenges I faced and
                how I overcame them. There will also be the ocoasional upcoming project
                and how I inted to implement it. The music page will be a showcase of my
                compositions as well as some of my performances. All of my compositions are
                available for purchase through the contact page.
