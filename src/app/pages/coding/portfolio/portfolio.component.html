                    When I started this project, I had no experience or knowledge of web development.
                    As such, the first thing I did was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
                    Once I felt comfortable I did research on the tech stack I wanted to use.

                <p>
                    The first big decision I had to make was what framework I wanted to use.
                    During my research the two frameworks that stood out to me were Angular and React.
                    I decided to go with angular because I liked the idea of having everything in one place.
                    Another reason I chose Angular was because I preferred the idea of having separate Typescript
                    and HTML files as opposed to TSX.
